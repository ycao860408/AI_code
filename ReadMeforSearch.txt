Dear TA:

You can simply run the code like "python3 hw2.2.py". Once it is ran. There is an instruction like below: 

This program is designed to apply different searching methods. You are required to type in a string in the form of '####X'. 
Each '#' represents a digit among 1, 2, 3, 4 and 'X' is used to indicate the methods you are going to use. For example, 
you may type in "1324a".

    d: 	 Depth First Search 

    b: 	 Breadth First Search 

    u: 	 Uniform-Cost Search 

    g: 	 Greedy Search 

    a: 	 A* Search 

Enter a string with example format and type q to quit!

And you can simply follow the instruction to enter the problem and method by hand and to type q to quite the program. And 
if you enter a string with invalid characters. The program will remind you like: 

Non-digit is found in ID part! Enter again, please. 

until your input is in the right form. And immediately, the program will give you an solution with relevant cost like:

2|413 g=0   h=4  
|2314 g=3   h=4  
41|32 g=7   h=3  
4|123 g=9   h=3  
4321  g=12  h=0  

That is all about how to run the code. Thank you for your hardworking. 

Best
